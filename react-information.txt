app.js called root component in react.

hot reload: add change to the app and display it without refresh the page.

component will be inside specific file, this file must represent the component.

the file name recommend to be the same component function.

self closing element: write html element, where this element can be closed with the same tag.

ternary operator: write the condition statement in a concise way.


state management: 
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1);
suppose the count = 0, if the setCount function is called two times the count value will stay 1 will not be 2 because setCount function work before when react change the state, therefore each time the setCount function called will read the count with its initial value that equal 0.
